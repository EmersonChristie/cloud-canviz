## Sprint 4 Plan

---

### Goal:

For sprint 4 the main goal will be to piece together all of the pieces that we have each made and make them cohesive in terms of style. We will also implement the ability to filter searches for art. We will attempt to do so with ElasticSearch, however if it becomes to difficult to complete before the end of the sprint we will implement filtering ourselvers in the backend with MongoDBs filtering functions.
