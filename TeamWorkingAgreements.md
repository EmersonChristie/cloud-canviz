--------------------------------------------------
Work Room: Baskin 302 / 340A

Meeting Times: M/W/F 10:00-10:30AM

Project Repo: <a href="https://github.com/EmersonChristie/cloud-canviz/blob/master/README.md">Link Here</a>
  Orginization: TODO
  
Communication Channels: Discord, SMS

*Development Enviroment*
--------------------------------------------------
Platform: All web browsers

IDE: VSCode

Other Tools: React, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, Amazon S3, Apollo

*Coding Styles / Standards*
--------------------------------------------------
We will use the same VSCode formater (Prettier) as well as ESLint for linting to keep uniform coding styles.

<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react">We will also draw insperation from the AirBnb React standard</a>
Prominent Standards:
  -Use single quotes ('') not double ("")
  -camelCase naming standard
  -Headers on each file
  -1 newline after each "component" (Functions, blocks, ...)

*Work Patterns*
--------------------------------------------------
Definition of done: 
-All acceptance creiteria is met
-All unit test are passed
-Everyone on the team agrees it is done

Team collabration: We have a steady communication going on in the Discord channel, seperating it between frontend, backend, useful links, etc.
We also use text for more urgent messages.
We regularly meet up outside of scheduled meeting times if we need to.
We also do pair programming during major implementation events.

Meet up with experts: We meet with our TA Meghan for team advice as well as attend workshops for specific topics that are of use to us.

Areas of responsibility:
-Frontend: Thomas, Yusef
-Backend: Emerson, Cameron, Farris
These tasks will change as sprints continue but these are the basic areas of responsibility.

Work hand-off / integration: When we integrate certian features we make sure that our team meets up and test the integration of whatever was integrated.

*Product Design Standards*
--------------------------------------------------
Look / Feel: Clean white feel that is intutitive as well as easy to use. There should be no confusion on functionality, where someting is, and where to get to something.

-Fonts: TODO

Product architecture: See slide

Common approach to common problems:
-I. Google it
-II. Ask other teammates
-III. Ask a TA (Scott most likley)

Error handeling: 
We will attempt to refactor code until the unit test is passed and if we cannot resolve an error we will use our common approach to problems. If at the end we still cannot fix an error after many attempts, we will meet as a team to discuss possible workarounds / reconsider a feature.
