*Work Patterns*
--------------------------------------------------
Definition of done: This we vary by task and will be specified in the sprint plan

Team collabration: We have a steady communication going on in the Discord channel, seperating it between frontend, backend, useful links, etc.
We also use text for more urgent messages.
We regularly meet up outside of scheduled meeting times if we need to.
We also do pair programming during major implementation events.

Meet up with experts: We meet with our TA Meghan for team advice as well as attend workshops for specific topics that are of use to us.

Areas of responsibility:
-Frontend: Thomas, Yusef
-Backend: Emerson, Cameron, Farris
These tasks will change as sprints continue but these are the basic areas of responsibility.

Work hand-off / integration: When we integrate certian features we make sure that our team meets up and test the integration of whatever was integrated.

*Product Design Standards*
--------------------------------------------------
Look / Feel: Clean white feel that is intutitive as well as easy to use. There should be no confusion on functionality, where someting is, and where to get to something.
